This is intended to be a client management system for fitness instructors and/or dietitians. It is meant to save time by automating part of the Q&A process 
between the professionals and their customers. Clients can register to make an account, then sign in and answer some routine questions every fitness advisor would ask,
like height, weight, age etc.
